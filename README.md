  <summary>👨‍💻 More about me</summary>

  - 💬 I am 32 years old, currently living in Brazil. I have a degree in architecture and urbanism since 2015 but at the end of 2023 I decided to change my career and started studying and joined the full stack programming course.
  - During my career as an architect, I have always had an affinity with the visual part of projects developed through graphic modeling, where I developed skill and curiosity with software in the area. I believe this made me more interested in Front-end.
  - Now as a student I am already taking my first steps using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, developed throughout the course. and I plan to learn React soon.
